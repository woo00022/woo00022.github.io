        Hi! My name's Tasia, it's derived from "Anastasia" but my
        parents just took the 'Tasia' part. 
        <br>
        I was born on June 28<sup>th</sup>! My age is a seceret..(402,418 - 402,396)...

        Fun fact - I am half Chinese, quarter Ukrainian,
        quarter French-Canadian! No I do not speak any of those languages! (Except for the mandatory french in Canadian schools).
        I'm actually very interested in languages, the ones I dabble in are: Swedish, Japanese, and Korean. 
        <br>
        Hoping to learn some Spanish as well. Really trying to get myself back
        into French, but right now I'm enjoying Swedish a lot because it's so close
        to English.

        Something else about me, I've actually taken the Animation program here
        at Algonquin College as well! I really love animation, but the industry <em>kind of</em> crashed during
        the writer's & actor's strike in the U.S. a few years ago. It's been taking a long time to
        get back and running again - so I decided to go back to school to get some more education, and hopefully
        be able to enter into different industries whenever I can/need! There's a lot of similarities which
        is nice, but the web dev/coding part is what I was intimidated about. Although I've always been interested,
        and so far I'm finding it fun!
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a dog named Hudson. He is <strong>super</strong> cute <abbr title="In My Opinon">IMO</abbr>. 
        Actually no, he's just objectively cute. I'll attach a photo with this assignment. 
        I'm 99% sure you were the prof that said you loved seeing pet photos,
        if you're not - I'm so sorry, but I hope you enjoy anyways.

        Thats all for now, thanks for reading!
        <br>
        Have fun!
