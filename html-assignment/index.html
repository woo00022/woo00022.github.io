    </article>
    <p>Hi! My name's Tasia. My name is derived from "Anastasia" but my
        parents just took the 'Tasia' part. 
        <br>I was born on June 28<sup>th</sup>! My age is a seceret..(402,418 - 402,395)...
        <br> 
        <br>Fun fact - I am half Chinese, quarter Ukrainian,
        quarter French-Canadian! No I do not speak any of those languages! (except for the mandatory french in Canadian schools).
        I'm actually very interested in languages, the ones I dabble in are: Swedish, Japanese, and Korean. 
        <br>
        Hoping to learn some spanish as well. Really trying to get myself back
        into french, but right now I'm enjoying Swedish a lot because it's so close
        to English. 
    </p>
    <p>Something else about me, <br>
        I've actually taken the Animation program here
        at Algonquin College as well! I really love animation, but the industry <em>kind of</em> crashed during
        the writer's & actor's strike in the U.S. a few years ago. It's been taking a long time to
        get back and running again - so I decided to go back to school to get some more education, and hopefully
        be able to enter into different industries whenever I can/need! There's a lot of similarities which
        is nice, but the web dev/coding part is what I was intimidated about. I've had a lot of interested because
        my dad is a programmer...engineer...whatever he does, but he works in military code so he doesn't know any
        of this stuff haha (another reason I don't know what he does).
    </p>
    <p>I have a dog named Hudson. He is super cute <abbr title="In My Opinon">IMO</abbr>. 
        No actually he's just objectively cute, I'll attach a photo with this assignment. 
        I am 99% sure you were the prof that said you loved seeing pet photos. 
        If you're not - I'm so sorry, but I hope you enjoy anyways. 
    </p>
