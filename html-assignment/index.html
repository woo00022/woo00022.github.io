    </article>
    <p>Hi! My name's Tasia. My name is derived from "Anastasia" but my
        parents just took the 'Tasia' part.
        <br> 
        Fun fact - I am half Chinese, quarter Ukrainian,
        quarter French-Canadian! No I do not speak any of those languages! (except for the mandatory french in Canadian schools).
        I'm actually very interested in languages, the ones I dabble in are...
        <ul>
            <li>Swedish</li>
            <li>Korean</li>
            <li>Japanese</li>
        </ul>
        Hoping to learn some spanish as well. Really trying to get myself back
        into french, but right now I'm enjoying Swedish a lot because it's so close
        to English. 
    </p>
    <p>Something else about me, <br>
        I've actually taken the Animation program here
        at Algonquin College as well! I really love animation, but the industry <em>kind of</em> crashed during
        the writer's & actor's strike in the U.S. a few years ago. It's been taking a long time to
        get back and running again - so I decided to go back to school to get some more education, and hopefully
        be able to enter into different industries whenever I can/need! There's a lot of similarities which
        is nice, but the web dev/coding part is what I was intimidated about. I've had a lot of interested because
        my dad is a programmer...engineer...whatever he does, but he works in military code so he doesn't know any
        of this stuff haha (another reason I don't know what he does).
    </p>
